Digital Forensics project analyzing browser artifacts using Nirsoft BrowsingHistoryView
# Browser Artifact Forensics using NirSoft (NirSoft + CSV Analysis)

This project focuses on digital forensics of web browser activity. Using **NirSoft BrowsingHistoryView**, I extracted, analyzed, and visualized browser artifacts to simulate a real-world investigation scenario â€” showcasing timeline reconstruction and user behavior analysis.

# Tools Used

-  NirSoft **BrowsingHistoryView**
-  Windows (data extraction)
-  CSV Viewer / Spreadsheet for analysis
-  Screenshots for documentation

# Project Objectives

- Simulate real-world forensic analysis of browser artifacts
- Extract evidence from browser history (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Identify key indicators like:
  - Visited domains
  - Timestamps
  - Browsing patterns
- Reconstruct timeline of user behavior

# Skills Demonstrated

- Digital forensics fundamentals
- Timeline reconstruction
- Evidence extraction & preservation
- CSV-based log analysis
- Report documentation

# Screenshots

All screenshots of evidence extraction and analysis are located in the `screenshots/` folder.

# Forensic Evidence

Raw output exported as `.CSV` from NirSoft tool is available in the `evidence/` folder:
- **Browser forensics yashwant.csv**

# Use Case Scenario

Imagine a SOC analyst or incident responder needs to verify user activity related to a phishing investigation. This project simulates such an extraction and presents the raw data for timeline verification.
